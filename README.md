## 1. Uncalibrated Stereo
In the previous project - [Pseudo LiDARS with Stereo Vison](https://github.com/yudhisteer/Pseudo-LiDARs-with-Stereo-Vision) - we have seen how we could use two sets of cameras separated by a distance ```b``` (baseline) and using the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, we would calculate the disparity, build a depth map, and ultimately get the distances of objects. In that scenario, all the parameters were provided to us from the KITTI dataset. 

But what if we have two images of the same scene taken by two different persons and perhaps two different cameras and we know the internal parameters of the cameras. From these two arbitrary views, can we compute the translation and rotation of one camera w.r.t another camera? If so. can we compute a 3D model of the scene? In this project, we will devise a method to estimate the 3D structure of a static scene from two arbitrary views.

**Assumption**:

1. Intrinsic parameters ![CodeCogsEqn](https://github.com/yudhisteer/3D-Reconstruction-with-Uncalibrated-Stereo/assets/59663734/093227d8-b5ea-4ec7-8a9f-163b8c829d9e) are **known** for both cameras. (Obtained from metadata of image)
2. Extrinsic parameters (relative position and orientation of the cameras) are **unknown**.

**Steps**:
1. Find **external parameters**, i.e., the relationship between the 3D coordinate frames of the two cameras.

2. To achieve this, we need to find reliable **correspondences** between the two arbitrary views. For calibration, a minimum of **eight matches** is sufficient.

3. Once correspondences are established, we can determine the **rotation** and **translation** of each camera with respect to the other. This calibrates the stereo system, and then we can find **dense correspondences**.

4. **Dense correspondences** mean finding the corresponding points in the right image for every point in the left image. Knowing the rotation and translation facilitates a **one-dimensional search** to find the dense 
correspondences.

5. With the dense correspondence map, we can **triangulate** and find the 3D location of points in the scene, computing their **depth**.
